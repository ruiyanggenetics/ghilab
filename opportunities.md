# Opportunities

As a new and growing lab, we are looking for **talented, curious, and energetic trainees**—including postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students—who are excited to push the frontiers of discovery and improve the lives of children and families affected by devastating **inborn errors of immunity**.

---

## Our Training Philosophy

Our philosophy is simple:

Science should be **ambitious and joyful**, driven by curiosity and self-motivation, and grounded in the **discipline and rigor** needed to produce clear, impactful results.

We aim to create an environment in which trainees:

- Take **real ownership** of their scientific questions  
- Receive **thoughtful, individualized mentorship**  
- Are supported with the **resources, structure, and intellectual freedom** needed to turn meaningful ideas into strong, publishable advances  

Our goal is that when you complete your PhD or postdoctoral training, you will not only have papers—you will have the **confidence, technical skills, and scientific vision** to thrive in your next chapter, whether that is in academia, medicine, biotech/pharma, data science, consulting, or something entirely new.
