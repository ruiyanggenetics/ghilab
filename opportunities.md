# Opportunities

As a new and growing lab, we are looking for **talented, curious, and energetic trainees**—including postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students—who are excited to push the frontiers of discovery and improve the lives of children and families affected by devastating inborn errors of immunity.

## Our Training Philosophy

Science should be bold and joyful, driven by curiosity and self-motivation, and grounded in the discipline and rigor needed to produce clear, impactful results that stand the test of time.

We aim to create an environment in which trainees:

- Take real ownership of their scientific program
- Receive thoughtful, individualized mentorship  
- Are supported with the resources, structure, and intellectual freedom needed to deliver strong, publishable advances  

Our goal is that when you complete your PhD or postdoctoral training, you will not only have papers—you will have the confidence, technical skills, and scientific vision to thrive in your next chapter, whether that is in academia, medicine, biotech/pharma, data science, consulting, or something entirely new.
