# The Laboratory of Genetics of Human Immunity

We study why only a small subset of people develop life-threatening infections or immune dysregulation while most remain asymptomatic.

Using humans as our primary model system, we integrate human genetics and immunology to uncover mechanisms of disease and protection.
