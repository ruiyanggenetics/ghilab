# Therapeutics for IEIs and Beyond

<p class="page-intro">
Human genetics provides a uniquely powerful framework for therapeutic discovery.
By identifying non-redundant immune pathways through naturally occurring genetic variation,
we aim to develop genetics-informed, mechanism-based therapies for inborn errors of immunity (IEIs),
and to extend these insights beyond rare monogenic disorders to patients with more common,
modest, or even mild clinical disease arising from dysregulation of the same pathways.

Human monogenic disorders provide direct causal links between gene function, immune pathways,
and disease phenotypes—offering a blueprint for precision therapy.

- Naturally occurring human mutations act as in vivo perturbation experiments,
  revealing which immune pathways are essential, non-redundant, or safely targetable in humans.

- Insights from human genetics have repeatedly led to transformative therapies that extend
  far beyond rare disease. Canonical examples include the discovery of LDLR deficiency
  informing statin therapy  
  ([PNAS, 2013](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3773794/))
  and the development of PCSK9 inhibition (e.g., evolocumab) for hypercholesterolemia  
  ([Circulation, 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38227713/)).

- Despite this promise, translation from genetic discovery to targeted therapy remains fragmented,
  and many IEIs still lack rational, mechanism-based treatments.

- Guided by the Brown–Goldstein paradigm, we aim to leverage insights from rare genetic
  disorders to inform therapies for broader populations who share dysregulation of the same
  immune pathways.

## Therapeutic Areas of Focus

- CD40–CD40L pathway dysregulation, spanning immune deficiency, immune dysregulation,
  and lymphoproliferative disease
- Life-threatening Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) disease, including immunodeficiency,
  lymphoproliferation, and malignancy

## Our Approach

Our therapeutic strategy is grounded in genetics-first reasoning and integrates:

- Human genetic discovery to define causal disease mechanisms
- Functional immunology to identify precise therapeutic leverage
- Pathway-informed intervention, prioritizing specificity, safety, and durability
