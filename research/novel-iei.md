# Exploration of Novel IEIs

<p class="page-intro">
Understanding why only a small subset of individuals develop life-threatening infections,
immune dysregulation, or malignancy reveals fundamental principles and non-redundant immune
pathways governing disease pathogenicity in humans.
</p>

## Background

Interindividual variability in susceptibility to infection, immune dysregulation,
and malignancy risk remains a fundamental and largely unanswered question in human biology.
Even among individuals exposed to the same pathogens, outcomes range from asymptomatic infection
to life-threatening disease, highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of protective
and pathological immunity.

- Extreme clinical variability during infection and immune dysregulation reflects
  underlying genetic and immunological determinants that are poorly understood  
  ([Annu Rev Pathol, 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7923385/);
  [PNAS, 2015](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1521644112)).

- Despite major advances in sequencing technologies, the diagnostic yield for patients
  with suspected inborn errors of immunity remains limited, at approximately 30%  
  ([Frontiers in Pediatrics, 2024](https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2024.1279112)),
  suggesting that many disease-causing genes, allelic variants, and mechanisms remain undiscovered.

- Identifying and characterizing novel IEIs not only enables precise diagnosis for the
  patients we study, but also uncovers essential immune pathways that govern host defense,
  immune regulation, and malignancy risk in humans.

## Key Questions We Ask

- Why do some individuals develop severe or life-threatening disease after otherwise common infections?
- Which immune pathways are non-redundant in humans causing or preventing patients from diseases of interests?
- How do monogenic defects predispose to immune dysregulation and cancer?

---

## Disease Phenotypes We Study

- **Life-threatening infections**, with a particular focus on Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
- **Immune dysregulation and malignancy** in the context of EBV infection
- **Broader spectra of immune dysregulation**, including autoimmunity and autoinflammation

---

## Our Approach

Our work is grounded in patient-oriented research and integrates:

- **Patient-driven discovery**, including deep clinical phenotyping, enrollment, and next-generation sequencing
- **Human genetics and immunology**, to link genotype to cellular and molecular immune phenotypes
- **Deep mechanistic investigation**, to establish causal relationships between genetic defects and disease

Rather than beginning with predefined pathways, we prioritize unbiased discovery in humans,
followed by rigorous functional validation in relevant immune systems.
