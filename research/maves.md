# Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs)

<p class="page-intro">
[One–two sentence high-level framing of why MAVEs are essential for understanding
genotype–function relationships and enabling accurate genetic diagnosis.]
</p>

---

## Background

[Paragraph introducing the challenge of variant interpretation, allelic heterogeneity,
and limitations of current functional annotation.]

- [Key unmet need / limitation in current variant interpretation]
- [Why single-variant or low-throughput approaches are insufficient]
- [How MAVEs address scale, rigor, and clinical translation]

---

## Key Questions We Ask

- [What functional consequences do variants have at scale?]
- [Which variants are pathogenic, hypomorphic, or benign?]
- [How do variant effects map onto disease mechanisms and clinical phenotypes?]

---

## Genes and Pathways of Interest

- **[Gene / pathway 1]**
- **[Gene / pathway 2]**
- **[Gene / pathway 3]**
- **[Optional: cancer-associated or immune-oncology genes]**

---

## Our Approach

Our MAVE platform integrates:

- **High-throughput variant generation**
- **Physiologically relevant cellular systems**
- **Quantitative functional readouts**
- **Rigorous statistical and computational analysis**

[Optional paragraph explaining how this enables direct translation to diagnosis,
mechanism, and therapy.]
