# Multiplexed Assays of Variant Effect (MAVEs)

<p class="page-intro">
Despite widespread use of clinical sequencing—including targeted gene panels, whole-exome
sequencing (WES), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)—the diagnostic yield for inborn errors
of immunity (IEIs) remains limited (~30%). A major barrier is the interpretation of variants
of uncertain significance (VUS). Our laboratory leverages multiplexed assays of variant effect
(MAVEs) to systematically map genotype–function relationships and generate comprehensive
functional atlases for key IEI genes.

## Background

Although sequencing technologies have rapidly advanced, interpretation has become the
primary bottleneck in genetic diagnosis. For IEIs in particular, many patients harbor rare
or private variants whose functional consequences cannot be inferred from sequence data alone.

- The majority of variants submitted to clinical databases such as ClinVar are classified as
  **variants of uncertain significance (VUS)**.
- The number of reported VUS continues to grow exponentially as sequencing expands  
  (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40691352/" target="_blank">PMID: 40691352</a>).
- Testing variants individually is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and impractical at scale.
- Functional studies performed across different laboratories often yield inconsistent or
  non-comparable results.

Together, these challenges limit the clinical utility of sequencing and delay diagnosis
for patients with suspected IEIs.

## Genes and Pathways of Interest

- Our group is actively developing MAVEs for several high-yield IEI genes, selected based on
  clinical relevance, genetic constraint, and unmet diagnostic need.
- These genes span pathways involved in immune activation, regulation, and malignancy risk,
  and are frequently associated with high rates of VUS in clinical testing.

## Our Approach

Our MAVE platform integrates:

- **High-throughput variant generation**, enabling near-saturation mutagenesis
- **Physiologically relevant cellular systems** tailored to gene-specific function
- **Quantitative functional readouts** that directly reflect immune phenotypes
- **Rigorous statistical and computational analysis** for reproducibility and clinical translation

By coupling human genetics with scalable functional genomics, we aim to convert uncertain
genetic variation into actionable biological and clinical insight.
